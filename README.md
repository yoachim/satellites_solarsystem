Checking how mega constellations impact solar system discoveries


Using some code from earlier repos, but whatever

grabbing data files from:
astro-lsst-01.astro.washington.edu:"/local/lsst/opsim/vatiras/"

## OK, what's the best way to go about this?  Maybe I advance the full constellation to the given MJD, find ones that are within some large distance (maybe 5-10 degrees). Then advance just those to mjd+visittime.
